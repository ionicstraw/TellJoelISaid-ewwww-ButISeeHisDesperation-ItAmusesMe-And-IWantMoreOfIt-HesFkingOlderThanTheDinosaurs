i dont want to get involved with eric schmidt, he's just a talking head talking about AI, i dont like that, im a serious person, i dont have time for this shit

lemme take care of this after my app is done before thanksgiving, i cant wrap my mind around it right now. absolute nuisance ... ill make u laugh tho 😂 but im busy now BC IM READING UR PAPERS thats why im busy

joels from oklahoma or something like that, like gtfo, i DO NOT care about this person AT ALL.

https://www.billiontoone.com/about/leadership-board there are all kinds of investors out there, we're not desperate to work with joel and absolutely im not, yeah the lights are on but no one's home, i dont want to deal with fking bullshit for years

im not signing any contact with this person, he seems very off, weird and unimpressive. there's a lot of great stuff out there, im not putting myself in any box. i have great ideas, ive worked hard in my life to be around great ppl. i dont want to be around someone who i think, goes on ebay to look for womens used underwear to sniff.
